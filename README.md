 ðŸ“ˆ Real-Time Stock Ticker Dashboard

A web-based dashboard that displays real-time stock market data.  
Users can search for stock symbols, view live prices, and monitor market trends with interactive charts.  

ðŸŽ¯ Objective
The Real-Time Stock Ticker Dashboard aims to provide users with instant, continuously updated stock information, helping investors and traders make data-driven decisions.  
Key goals:
- Fetch and display real-time stock prices from APIs.
- Visualize stock trends with interactive charts.
- Provide a responsive, user-friendly interface.

âš¡ Features
- Real-time stock price updates  
- Search for any stock symbol (e.g., AAPL, TSLA)  
- Color-coded price change (green for gain, red for loss)  
- Interactive charts showing intraday or historical trends  
- Auto-refresh every few seconds  
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile  
- Deployment-ready on GitHub Pages / Vercel  

ðŸ›  How It Works
1. User enters a stock symbol in the input box.  
2. The app sends a request to Alpha Vantage API (or other API) to fetch stock data.  
3. JSON response is parsed to get price, symbol, and percentage change.  
4. UI dynamically updates with latest stock info.  
5. Charts visualize stock trends over time.  
6. Auto-refresh ensures the dashboard always shows live data.
